    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <h3>With great power comes great responsibility</h3>
    <p>Data Loader can change your data in a big way that may not be possible to reverse if mistakes are made. By using it, you acknowledge that you
      understand the risks in mass-importing, mass-updating and mass-deleting data in Bullhorn.</p>
    <h3>Be mindful of others</h3>
    <p>Data Loader can load millions of records in a very short time from an API user. This can have an impact on actual users of the system. If you
      plan to load more than 100,000 records at once, please do it off-hours.</p>
    <h3>For more information</h3>
    <p>Consult the <a href="https://github.com/bullhorn/dataloader/wiki">Data Loader Wiki</a> for more helpful ideas. Report bugs or feature
      requests through the <a href="https://github.com/bullhorn/dataloader/issues">Data Loader Issues</a> on GitHub.
